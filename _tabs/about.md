Hi! Welcome to my fan blog dedicated to the [Flesh and Blood TCG](https://fabtcg.com). It is mostly an exercise in writing and creativity for myself, but I am thrilled to have you along for the ride.

## What type of content can you expect?
Personally, I enjoy thinking about the unexplored design space within a game's framework. In this blog, I aim to identify parts of the design that have not been explored to their fullest potential and share ideas that I would like Legend Story Studios (LSS) to explore in future sets.

## Why the name?
If you stumbled across this website, you probably know that [Plasma Mainline](https://dhhim4ltzu1pj.cloudfront.net/media/images/DYN093.width-450.format-webp.webp) is a card from the Flesh and Blood card game which first appeared in the set Dynasty. Though you may suspect this indicates a proclivity for the Mechanologist class, I am not a Mechanologist main (though I do enjoy the class!). Instead, I thought it would be a fun nod to have the name refer to my main line of work: plasma physics research (get it?).

## About me as a player
I started playing Flesh and Blood in the summer of 2021, between the releases of Monarch Unlimited and Tales of Aria First Edition. My first decks were Viserai and Boltyn, but I have enjoyed various other decks and formats since then. I consider myself a casual competitive player, by which I mean that I enjoy competing in local events (Armories, PQs, RtNs, and the occasional Calling, BH, or Nationals), but will not actively prepare to win a major event like a Pro Tour or the World Championship anytime soon.
