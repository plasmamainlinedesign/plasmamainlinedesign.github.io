Of all the mechanics in Flesh and Blood, "pitching for second cycle" is one of the concepts that I hear referred to most often when it comes to levelling up your gameplay when you start to dive deeper into the game. Due to the fact that pitched cards go to the bottom of your deck, with practice you can set up the perfect draw sequence for when you have gone through your deck once. This is referred to as the second cycle. This feature of the game was demonstrated expertly by both competitors in this 2-hour [semifinal game of Pro Tour: Baltimore (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEsXKU7jrI0). However, playing for second or third cycle (and beyond) requires a lot of mental energy. To alleviate this burden and ensure that players stay in shape when they commit to this game plan, I propose a new mechanic: the pitch snack.

## Snack cards
The concept is simple: whenever you pitch a __Snack__ card, you set up another snack in your pitch stack for you to consume in the next cycle of your deck. Here is an example, _Smörgåsbord_. When you pitch this, it is banished at the end of your turn and replaced with a snack of your choice: _Healthy Snack_ or _Sweet Treat_. When you cycle through your deck, you get to eat the snack you chose and replace it with a different one. Perfect to keep your energy levels high and your brain focused as you progress through the game!
